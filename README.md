# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I say this one's, the campfire song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it good then man you're so wrong
But it'll help if can tune in 
Bum, bum, buuum...
try singing the campfire song with us it's going to be lots of fun
When everyone is together under the sun
come on and tune in along our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G 
And if you don't like it than we can sing i good then man you're so wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Hey you don't need to be perfect just be in picth 
and everything will be all set 

Just give it a try and we can jam out to 
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song 

Bum,bum,buuum...
